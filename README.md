## 🧠 Project Overview
The **AI Financial Inclusion Assistant** is a Streamlit-based machine learning prototype that helps **families raising children with special needs** predict their upcoming monthly expenses and receive **personalized financial advice**.  

This project was inspired by my volunteer work with **Special Olympics Kenya**, where I interacted with children with intellectual and physical disabilities and their families. Many of these households face financial strain due to therapy sessions, medication costs, and specialized education.  

Combining my **background in Financial Engineering** and **AI training**, I built this tool to promote **financial inclusion**, aligning with:  
- **SDG 1:** No Poverty  
- **SDG 10:** Reduced Inequalities  


## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict next month’s household expenses based on income and expense data.  
- Provide a **Financial Health Score** to evaluate spending efficiency.  
- Offer personalized budgeting and savings advice.  
- Allow users to **choose between a Random Forest model and a Deep Learning model** for prediction.  
- Demonstrate an **end-to-end AI pipeline** from data to deployment.  


## ⚙️ Tech Stack
| Category | Tools & Libraries |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Programming Language** | Python |
| **Machine Learning** | Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor) |
| **Deep Learning** | TensorFlow / Keras |
| **Frontend** | Streamlit |
| **Data Handling** | Pandas, NumPy |
| **Deployment** | Streamlit Cloud |
| **Model Storage** | joblib (.joblib), H5 (.h5) |


## 🧩 How It Works
1. **User Input:**  
   Families enter income and expense details (salary, business income, rent, school fees, therapy, etc.).  

2. **Model Selection:**  
   Users can choose between:  
   - 🟩 **Random Forest Regressor (Default):** Fast and stable predictions.  
   - 🧠 **Deep Learning Model (TensorFlow):** Captures complex non-linear expense trends.  

3. **Prediction Stage:**  
   The selected model predicts next month’s total expenses.  
   A “realism correction” ensures predictions stay within logical income limits.  

4. **Insights Generation:**  
   The app displays:  
   - Predicted total monthly expenses  
   - A **Financial Health Score** (progress bar)  
   - Personalised budgeting tips and financial advice  

5. **AI Financial Advisor (NLP):**  
   A rule-based chatbot answers financial questions about savings, grants, loans, and insurance options.  

6. **Support Resources:**  
   The app provides links to government and NGO programs like NCPWD, NHIF, and Special Olympics Kenya.

📊 Example Inputs
| Category         | Example (KES) |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Salary Income    | 25,000        |
| Business Income  | 5,000         |
| Side Hustle      | 2,000         |
| Rent             | 8,000         |
| Food & Groceries | 5,000         |
| Physiotherapy    | 2,000         |
| Medication       | 1,000         |
| School Fees      | 4,000         |
## 📈 Expected Output

Predicted Total Monthly Expenses: KSh 23,500 (example)

Financial Health Score: 72%

Advice: “Your spending is balanced. Try saving 10% monthly for emergencies.”
## 🧠 Model Details
Model Type	Description	Use Case
Random Forest Regressor: A tree-based ensemble model trained on synthetic Kenyan household data.	Default option — provides fast, explainable predictions for small datasets.
Deep Learning Model (TensorFlow/Keras)	A simple feedforward neural network trained on the same dataset.	Optional — captures complex, non-linear expense patterns when more data is available.

## Dataset:
Synthetic data simulating realistic Kenyan household expenses, including special needs–related costs (e.g., therapy, medications, special education).

## Features:
14 numeric inputs (income sources + general + special needs expenses).

## Evaluation Metrics:

Coefficient of Determination (R²)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Future Enhancements:

Integrate real anonymised expense data from NCPWD or NGOs.

Fine-tune the deep learning architecture for higher accuracy.

Replace rule-based NLP with a fine-tuned transformer model (e.g., BERT).

## 🚀 Deployment

The app is deployed publicly via Streamlit Cloud.

##🧾 Example Use Case

A parent caring for a child with autism enters their household income and therapy costs.
The AI model predicts next month’s likely expenses, calculates a financial health score, and provides tailored savings and budgeting advice — helping the family plan ahead while linking them to disability support programs.
